# 🌐 NovaClean — AI-Powered YouTube Comment Moderator

NovaClean is a web-based application that leverages artificial intelligence to detect and assist creators in moderating spam comments—especially related to online gambling—on their YouTube videos. This project was developed as part of a youth innovation initiative to counter digital threats with technology.

> **Disclaimer**: This repository is for educational and showcase purposes only. The service may require configuration that is not provided publicly due to security and licensing concerns.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically detects spam or gambling-related comments using pattern-based AI.
- Utilizes a secondary AI layer to boost detection accuracy.
- OAuth2-based Google login with full permission control (comment deletion, hiding, or reporting).
- Lightweight UI that supports fast usage without installations.
- Database integration for session handling and user account control.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NovaClean.git
   cd NovaClean
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory.
   The required environment variables involve API keys and domain settings, but they **won’t be shared in this repository** for obvious reasons.
   You are expected to already know what to put there based on your system configuration and access level. 😉

4. Place your Google OAuth credentials in the following path:

   ```
   config/credentials_youtube_api.json
   ```

   > ⚠️ This file is required to run any YouTube API-related services. Make sure it's structured properly as expected by Google's OAuth system.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works (Conceptually)

NovaClean performs layered analysis on YouTube comments pulled via the YouTube Data API. The first layer uses classic rule-based matching. If uncertain, the comment is forwarded to a more advanced language model through a secondary API service. The system ensures only verified users can perform moderation on their own content.
